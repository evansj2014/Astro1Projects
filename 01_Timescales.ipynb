        "An object's temperature, the average motion of its particles, determines what kind of electromagnetic radiation it emits because the atoms colliding give off electromagnetic radiation. An object that absorbs all radiation without reflecting or scattering is called a blackbody. This absorption eventually causes the object to heat up until absorption and radiation are in balance. Understanding that a blackbody emits radiation at all wavelengths, an object with a higher temperature emits more power at all wavelengths, and a higher temperature corresponds to a shorter wavelength allows us to come up with a way to measure the temperature of stars. For example, a blue star is hotter than a red star because it has a shorter wavelength. A more precise way to measure the temperature of a star can be done using Wein's Law. This gives the wavelength that maximum power is emitted where the wavelength is in nanometers, the temperature is in Kelvin, and the constant ${3 \\times 10^{6}}$ has units of nm x K: $$ \\lambda_{max} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{6}}{T}$$\n"
