# Astro1Projects

Everyone's files are uploaded here.  I had to modify some of the data file pathways.  They are linked back to Dr. Petit's original GitHub repository in most cases.  Otherwise, I linked them to this GitHub repository.  

All of the Jupyter notebooks have been run, so the outputs can be viewed directly in GitHub.  However, if you want to play with them, they can be opened and run in Google Colab.  

Please review yours to make sure that I did not break it.  I have verified that they all run with no errors, but please double check me to make sure I didn't accidentally change anything else.  If you do find a mistake, let me know so that I can commit the correction to this repository.  

I intend to make this repository private after the semester is over, so if you want your own copy, make sure you clone it before then.  

Let me know if you see anything I can do to make the repository better. Thanks!
